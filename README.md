## File Encryption Tool

- Description: A tool for encrypting and decrypting files using strong encryption algorithms. This could be especially
  useful for securing sensitive project files or data.
- Why Rust?: Rust's emphasis on safety and its support for low-level operations make it a good choice for
  cryptography-related tasks.
- Learning Opportunities: Cryptography fundamentals, file IO, CLI programming, and possibly GUI development for easier
  interaction.

## Secure Backup System

- Description: A system that automatically backs up files to a remote server or cloud storage, with strong encryption
  before transmission. The focus is on ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.
- Why Rust?: Rust's efficiency and safety are key for handling file operations and secure network communications, making
  it ideal for developing a reliable backup system.
- Learning Opportunities: Implementing encryption algorithms, network programming for file transfer, integrating with
  cloud storage APIs, and developing a scheduler for automatic backups.

## Secure File Sharing Service

- Description: A tool that allows users to securely share files over the internet, with end-to-end encryption to ensure
  that files can be accessed only by the intended recipient.
- Why Rust?: The need for high performance and security in transferring files over the network makes Rust a suitable
  choice.
- Learning Opportunities: Network programming, implementing file encryption/decryption, developing a web interface or
  CLI, and understanding secure file transfer protocols.

## Personal Data Vault

- Description: A highly secure application for storing personal information, such as passwords, identification
  documents, and financial records. It focuses on strong encryption, secure access controls, and perhaps even
  self-hosted options for those particularly concerned with privacy.
- Why Rust?: Rust's emphasis on safety and performance is crucial for building applications that handle very sensitive
  personal data.
- Learning Opportunities: Implementing advanced encryption standards, GUI development for ease of use, data organization
  strategies, and developing backup and recovery mechanisms.
